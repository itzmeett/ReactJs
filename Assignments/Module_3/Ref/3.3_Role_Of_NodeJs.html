    <div class="question">
        3. What is NPM in React Js?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>High server load:</strong> Using Nodejs with React makes sense when your web application needs
            handling of multiple requests and maintaining server load balance. </p>
        <p><strong> Real-time data:</strong> If your applicationâ€™s core is based on Real-time Data-Intensive management
            or Data Streaming, using Nodejs is highly advisable for continued server connection. </p>
        <p><strong>JSON APIs: </strong>Building JSON APIs for your application is very efficient with Nodejs due to
            high code reusability and easy code sharing in Reactjs.</p>
        <p><strong> Single Page Applications (SPA): </strong>Developing Single Page Applications in React while using
            Node to build a lightweight backend model for asynchronous data loading through callback functions. </p>
        <p><strong> MERN stack: </strong>Nodejs can also be used with React with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and
            Nodejs) stack.
        <p>
        <p><strong>Scalability: </strong>Node and React enables developers to build multi-device, responsive,
            data-driven web apps with scalability for large projects, ensuring optimal website performance across
            various devices.</p>
        <p><strong>Fast Development: </strong>Using React and Node for web app development yields high ROI, saving time
            and money. These technologies excel in creating fast and easy-to-maintain websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Single Language for Front-end and Back-end: </strong>Using Node and React together, developers avoid
            the need to learn complex back-end languages like Python or Ruby. They can use Node for server-side
            development and React for front-end coding seamlessly, saving resources, money, and time.</p>
        <p><strong> Organized Process: </strong>The combo of React and Node streamlines web development. These
            scalable, effective, and fast technologies work together to create high-functioning websites.</p>
