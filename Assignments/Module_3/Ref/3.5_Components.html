            5. What is Role of Node Js in react Js?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>React has its own command-line interface (CLI) commands.</p>
            <p>A command-line interface is a way that you can interact with a computer through text.</p>
            <p>It works by you typing in special commands in a command prompt.</p>
            <p>This was the way developers interacted with computers before Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) were created.</p>
            <p>Command-line interfaces are still useful for automating tasks and in software development generally.</p>
